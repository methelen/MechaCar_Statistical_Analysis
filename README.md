## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is notably less than 0.05% and the R-squared value is 0.715. This linear model therefore predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes 70% effectively. This isn't a particulary great probability, so further analysis could be done to create a more effective prediction.
